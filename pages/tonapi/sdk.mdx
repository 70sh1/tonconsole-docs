# Guide for Using SDK with TonAPI

TonAPI is designed using Swagger, thus enabling the generation of SDKs in any language. The associated Swagger file can be obtained using the following link: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonkeeper/opentonapi/master/api/openapi.yml

The command to generate the SDK is provided below. The sample command is for Python, but it can easily be adapted for usage with other languages:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/master/bin/swagger-codegen-cli.jar

java -jar swagger-codegen-cli.jar generate -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tonkeeper/opentonapi/master/api/openapi.yml -l python -o /path/to/output
```
Note: Remember to replace '/path/to/output' with the actual path where you wish to generate the SDK.

You also would need an Java virtual machine installed on your system to run the above command.

We also provide already build and prepared Packages for your convinience, plus our SDKs are also provide functions for streaming SDKs, which you would not get from swaagger file.
