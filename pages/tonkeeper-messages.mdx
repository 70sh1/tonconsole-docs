> Enable push notifications for your decentralized apps to increase user engagement.

You can enable push notifications only for registered apps: sign in TonConsole via Telegram and create a new project. You will be able to edit the project later.

1. Go to `Tonkeeper Messages` to register an app.
2. Click `TonConnect Manifest URL` to select a way for registering an app.
    1. The system will generate a unique payload. Put the payload into a `tc-verify.json` file and make it available at `https://test.io/tc-verify.json`.
3. Verify your app.

You will see the statistics and token of your app after the verification.

**The token is secret, donâ€™t give it to any third party.** You will have to pass the token into the header every time you request push notifications.

To send a message to one wallet, pass the `"address": "EQ...ER"` into the request body. `"..."` is a wallet address.

To send a message to all the users, skip the `"address"` field.

```json
{
  "message": "hello",
  "address": "EQ...ER",
  "link": "http://my_dapp.com/event"
}
```

One message can have only 255 characters.
